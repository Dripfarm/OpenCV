# OpenCV for Apple platforms

This repository provides pre-built universal OpenCV binaries and demos for Apple platforms: iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, Mac, and simulators.

## Supported platforms and architectures

Building OpenCV as an `.xcframework` library allows us to support multiple platforms with a single binary.

| Platform | Architecture | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS/iPadOS | ARM64 | ‚úÖ |
| iOS/iPadOS simulator | ARM64 | ‚úÖ |
| iOS/iPadOS simulator | x86_64 | ‚úÖ |
| visionOS | ARM64 | ‚úÖ |
| visionOS simulator | ARM64 | ‚úÖ |
| Mac Catalyst | ARM64 | ‚úÖ |

### [‚¨áÔ∏è Download opencv2.xcframework](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/tree/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/opencv2.xcframework)

## How to run

This repository includes a [sample project](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/tree/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform). Here's what you need to do:

1. [Download opencv2.xcframework](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/tree/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/opencv2.xcframework).
1. Create an Xcode multiplatform project.
2. Add opencv2.xcframework under `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`.
3. Create a [Bridging Header](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/blob/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform-Bridging-Header.h).
4. Create a [Prefix Header](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/blob/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/PrefixHeader.pch).
5. Add and populate our [OpenCV wrapper](https://github.com/LightBuzz/OpenCV/blob/main/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/OpenCV-Apple-Mutliplatform/OpenCVWrapper.mm).
6. Select your build target (iPhone device, visionOS device, simulator, etc).
7. Run.
